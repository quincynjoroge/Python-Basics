# Python-Basics
This repository is for anyone who wants to brush up on their Python basics or who is just getting started with Python. I decided to make this so that I could refresh my Python knowledge while also sharing it with others.

Feel free to go through the fundamentals of Python. :)

### Please keep in mind that these Notebooks are from a course I took with edx, a website that offers data science courses.
